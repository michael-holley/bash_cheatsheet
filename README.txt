# bash_cheatsheet
This is a bash cheatsheet. I used it to study and practice bash scripting. 

JUST A HEADS UP
Everything in this cheatsheet is commented out (the # at the beginning of each line of text) because many of the scripts within the sheet conflict with each other. If you want to run a script, they are separated by empty lines and the simple explanation of what each script is in capital letters. Removing the # at the beginning of each line in the script will allow it to run. There isn't very many detailed explanations in the code because it is not entirely built for you to cheat off of. It is more of a starting point for you to dive deeper into bash so keep that in mind.

Use this to get a basic understanding of the scripting language and then you can refer to it later without detailed expanations to jog your memory. Also, the lack of explanations helps keep it decluttered since every line is already commented out. I like simplicity in not only my code, but my life. 

If you want one with every detail of what is happening, I will make one. This is just the one I personally used and it is based on my personal process of learning.
